Find Valid Lottery Number


Winning Ticket!
Your favourite grandpa, Rick, is crazy about the lottery and even crazier about how he picks his
“lucky” numbers. And even though his “never fail” strategy has yet to succeed, Grandpa Rick
doesn’t let that get him down. Every week he searches through the Sunday newspaper to find a
string of digits that might be potential lottery picks. But this week the newspaper has moved to a
new electronic format, and instead of a comfortable pile of papers, Grandpa Rick receives a text
file with the stories. Help your grandpa find his lotto picks. Given a large series of number
strings, return each that might be suitable for a lottery ticket pick.

Note that a valid lottery ticket must have 7 unique numbers between 1 and 59, digits must be
used in order, and every digit must be used.
